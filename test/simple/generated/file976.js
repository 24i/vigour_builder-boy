America is Back

Donald J. Trump For President, Inc. –– Why Now?

On November 8, 2016, the American People delivered a historic victory and took our country back. This victory was the result of a Movement to put America first, to save the American economy, and to make America once again a shining city on the hill. But our Movement cannot stop now - we still have much work to do.

This is why our Campaign Committee, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., is still here.

We will provide a beacon for this historic Movement as our lights continue to shine brightly for you ­­- the hardworking patriots who have paid the price for our freedom. While Washington flourished, our American jobs were shipped overseas, our families struggled, and our factories closed - that all ended on January 20, 2017.

This Campaign will be a voice for all Americans, in every city near and far, who support a more prosperous, safe and strong America. That’s why our Campaign cannot stop now - our Movement is just getting started.

Together, we will Make America Great Again!
